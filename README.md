# [rovi_blog](https://rovidecena.com/blog/).

As the name implies, rovi_blog is the name of my blog. At the time of writing, there isn't much content on it, but it'll be used mainly to talk about projects I'm working on -- about code, music, and games. If anything else comes to mind, I'll post it on there as well.

This website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Theme is built off a heavily modified version of [no-style-css](https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please).

I don't have an automated build process, so I have to manually generate the build files, then transfer them over. This repository will almost always have posts that I'm working on that haven't been released because of this.
