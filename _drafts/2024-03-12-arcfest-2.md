Around the start of the year (2024, at the time of writing), Unity made some changes to it's pricing model, a move loved by everyone (lie). If you were a game developer, or even just active enough on social media, you probably already knew about this, but just to future proof (and for anyone out of the loop), Unity changed their developer monetization plan to pay a fee that developers would have to pay per install of their game.

I'm not going to act like I actually crunched the numbers myself to see how it could've affected me, but the entire discourse made me realize it's likely not the best of choices to have the majority of my game development experience be in a singular game engine.

There were a few choices people were discussing at the time, but I settled upon Godot as the next engine for me to learn. I'm more interested in 2D development, and I heard pretty positive things about Godot's toolset.

Unreal Engine was the other popular candidate, but I kept getting the impression that it was tailored for triple-A game development (after all, Epic uses it for their own games), and I had no interest in getting into a game engine meant for large teams -- I like coding in small teams, or by myself.

> Also, I refused to learn C++. Too hard.

Initially, I going to learn it on my own time -- but then got bored, then forgot about it.

...

After, I tried learning it for the Winnipeg Game Jam 2024, then it turns out the team I was paired with was much more comfortable with Unity (including me), so we used that instead. 

...

After a few more weeks of not touching Godot, I figured the best way to learn it was just to jump headfirst into a project.

So, I made a sequel to Arcfest.

## arcfest?

Arcfest was a side project I worked on in high school. It was a top-down fighting game where you played as a spaceship trying to knock another into an ever closing zone. Rounds were short, hovering around thirty seconds, with a full match taking less than five minutes.

Each ship had two abilities at their disposal; a dash slash and a missle attack. Missles were the easy-to-use ability; firing a staggered cluster of homing missles at the enemy ship, with the dash slash giving a melee option that had the additional purposes of being a burst of movement and a source of defense by being able to destroy enemy missles.

This isn't an analysis on Arcfest, so I won't go too into depth about how I felt about the original game, but the simple premise made it an easy choice for learning a new game engine.

Plus, I've always wanted to see what a revamped Arcfest could be.

## development

I decided to do something bit different with this post, and write about development as I develop. We'll see how it goes, but if you get confused by unbalanced focused into technical stuff, it's probably because I was getting stuck on something.

Also, stuff may not be ordered in the best way for readability. Whoops!

### movement

Player movement is basically the first thing I start on every project -- it's one of the first things you want to be able iterate and tweak, after all. For Arcfest, it's relatively easy, as the game doesn't have any actual level collision.

The actual act of moving a player is a big part of getting movement to feel good, of course, but it's important to remember the other feedback the player can get -- visual, audio, and even haptic responses all play a role in how fun it is to move around.

Aeonics actually had a pretty simple system; light trails! As you move your ship, you leave a trail of light behind you that follows your movement path, creating flowy arcs.

Aeonics II built on the trail visuals of the original, but with just a bit more polish, with brighter colours and a darker background to give more of a glow affect, as well as adding different trails for different ships.
