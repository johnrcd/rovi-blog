I think ann important part of game design (and game development overall) is experiencing a wide variety of games. This can mean the classics, 

where was I going with this

At some point, I got interested in playing Hollow Knight. For a quick overview, the game I've always been a big fan of 2D action combat, and I basically heard nothing but praise from Hollow Knight at the time, so I figured

## metroidvanias???

Metroidvania's are an interesting game genre that sort of make me think of puzzle games. The key feature they have in my opinion is that progression is not linear -- you're not moving from left to right, and the objective isn't always straightforward. Additionally, a common theme in Metroidvania's is unlocking more and more of the map as your character gets stronger. This is often quite direct -- a tall, unclimable wall becomes an area to venture into once you unlock the ability to climb surfaces.

I'll talk about more about Hollow Knight, the Metroidvania genre, and how I feel about them, but the main thing you get out of these games is a sense of familiarity with the world. 


I'm not sure how much of that applies to me, seeing as I'm more of a programmer, but it would be pretty weird of me to be interested in indie game development and assume that I'd only ever be programming.

## open ended world, and the illusion of it

## it's movement abilities all the way down

I remember thinking at some point; I swear half of the progression locking in this game is based entirely on movement; a dash, double jump, wall climb, and super dash.

Having movement abilities as part of your progression locks is probably the best solution for most cases because it both:
- Makes progression locks obvious to see and understand,
- Extends the combat of the gamewithout having to introduce complex features.

For an example of the former point:

Even I, as someone who has never played a Metroidvania, was able to figure out where to go once I unlocked the Mothwing Cloak.
