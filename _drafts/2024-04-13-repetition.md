## megalovania??

- explanation of megalovania -

The main thing that I find interesting about Megalovania is that Toby Fox has used it several times, each time a different version created.

- The original was a romhack of Earthbound called *Radiation Halloween Hack*.
- A remix was created for Homestuck, a webcomic Toby Fox worked on as a composer.
- And of course, for Undertale, as Sans's boss theme.

SIDENOTE: Appearently there was a remix of the original Earthbound Megalovania, released for another fangame called *MOTHER: Cognitive Dissonance*. My brain fried a bit trying to figure out the history of Megalovania, because I was about to include it then I realized that it wasn't actually made by Toby Fox.
