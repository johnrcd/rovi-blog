Hello!

This document (blog post?) goes over a game idea I've had for a long time, known as Picket's Quest. The earliest public mention of Picket's Quest was from an old build of the game I recorded https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP-8HGRQEXQ, but the game was in planning for at least a year before then.

The purpose of this document is to explain the concept. It can be considered a pitch document towards developers who I think would be interested in the game. I might also just send it to people who I want. Anything can happen.

## summary

## design

Picket's Quest 

### picket cannot speak

Picket does not speak. He cannot communicate through words. This is not simply just a way to immerse the player into the game -- there is an obvious communication barrier between Picket and the other characters of the game because of his inability to talk.

#### communication through action

Picket's Quest will have a decent amount of dialogue, and while naturally Picket won't be able to influence a lot of dialogue chosen, Picket is not simply just a bystander, and does want to communicate.

At certain points in a conversation, rather than being given a choice tree, the player will be given time to perform an action. These actions are almost always actions that are performed normally in gameplay, such as jumping, crouching, or even standing still and doing nothing.

It's important to note that while the player can respond through an "action response", this isn't supposed to be a standardized system. A character may say something like "jump for yes, crouch for no," but others may not know of his muteness during the conversation and say something like

> "Why are you just jumping. That's not an answer?"

#### silence/no reaction is a response



### picket cannot fight

### you are not picket
