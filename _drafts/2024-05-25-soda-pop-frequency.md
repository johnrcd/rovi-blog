## songs

### BANANA!

BANANA! is the kick-off song for Soda Pop Frequency, hitting you with a blast of energy that persists for practically all of the song. 

To put it simply -- in my opinion, this is the best song in the album, and possibly the best song I've released up to this point (26 May, 2024).

The origins for this song actually started from one of my older albums, Bearbear and the Boys. Specifically, the track Bongo Jump.

For some quick context, Bearbear and the Boys was an album I quickly whipped up while I tested out a 90 day trial of Ableton Live they were offering at the time. I consider most of the songs to be medicore (and some of them downright terrible), but Bongo Jump stood out to me as it had the most polish. I wanted to make a sequel to it of sorts, as it represented a style I had been slowly developing that I called "happy percussive music."

I think the main thing that pops out in the song is how prominent the leads and melodies are. My upbeat music tends to revolve around a glorified backing track (what are dynamics???) as an excuse to make catchy melodies, but I cranked that dial up to 11 for this one. Once the verse starts, the melodies just start swinging one after the other. While writing this, I ended up noticing that the only times the song would have a gap in the melody is when there was a sudden drop in energy.

- Intro > Verse > Pre-Chorus > Chorus > ((lead break))
- Verse > Pre-Chorus > Chorus > ((lead break))
- Break > ((lead break))

(1:02, 2:15, and 3:10)

The only real issue I had with BANANA! is that there were so much elements to try and manage. I went through four different stages in the mixing process, each stage separated by a few months of ignoring the song to work on other stuff.

- banana_mix_3.wav (first mix i liked)
- banana_mix_5.wav (i wanted more bass, didn't put enough)
- banana_mix_8.wav (i wanted more bass, put way too much)
- banana_mix_10.wav (reduced the bass, made everything more saturated)

As implied, banana_mix_10.wav was the final one.

> Q: Is it the right amount of bass, though?

> A: Honestly, no idea.

It seems good to me, but so did mix 8, 5, and 3, for awhile. But, y'know... I do music for fun. I mix because I want it to sound good, but after a certain point I don't enjoy the song anymore. I am happy with this mix (hence why I published it), but in a different universe I might've gotten it to sound better.

Probably not, though. (?)

### Hot Chocolate

This song is one of the ones where I had made it noticably before the song that "identified" the album (BANANA!), but I added it because it fit.

Well, fit is certainly one of the terms to use. Hot Chocolate is significantly different from BANANA!.

Hot Chocolate initially started off as a song for a Lo-Fi album I was working on; a sequel to Coastline that ended up getting scrapped and changed around to become incognizance. It was too energetic and happy to really fit in incognizance, so I ended up putting it in this album when I noticed that it could fit.

If "energy level" was the only decider in what to put for Soda Pop Frequency, then Hot Chocolate wouldn't have been considered. But, it does have a few qualities that made it a good candidate;

- Complex percussion,
- Catchy melodies,
- and a THICK BASS.

I think the noticably-fake rhythm guitar adds a lot of charm to the song. The tone doesn't come close to an actual guitar, but it feels very homey. The notes themselves are slightly-off in a way that feels like it could've been played live had the instrument sounded a bit more realistic. This is most prominent in 2:21, where the rhythm guitar is by itself.

Honestly, I'm just happy I could get this song out at all.

REFERENCE: Hot Chocolate first started development on the 29th of August, 2022. It originally went by "Blooming in the Night," though I swapped it later on as I wanted to go for a food-based naming convention.
