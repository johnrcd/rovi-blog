When I first started making music, it wasn't really because I was inspired by anyone -- it was because a friend randomly recommended me an online music creating website, and then I proceeded to spend the next week randomly putting stuff together without much thought.

Basically, I don't really make covers. While I enjoy performing (somewhat), I like making stuff, and there isn't much enjoyment in covering other people's stuff, in my opinion.

Then I randomly got a massive surge of energy while watching a cutscene compliation of Sonic Colors and immediately decided that I wanted to make a cover of Endless Possibilities.

## cover time

At the time of getting that surge of energy, I knew that I wanted to satisfy my desire to make a cool cover over anything else.

Q: That sounds so weird

A: hold on

What I mean to say is that I didn't want to get bogged down by all the things I found boring (or at least not exciting in the moment): arranging, comping, mixing, etc. One thing I'm terrible at is always wanting to expand the scope of my projects -- it's easy to get lost in the excitment, so I didn't want to do that for

### double tracking 

When recording for a song, one technique that gets used a lot is called double tracking, where you record the same part twice and layer them on top of each other. This is commonly combined with panning each part left and right, so your left ear predominantly hears one part, while your right hears the other.

Double tracking is nice to listen to because it makes an instrument/voice feel wider. Each part doesn't really feel separate -- they end up blending together to sound like one bit unit. 

Not every part should be doubled tracked (otherwise you'll have too much sounds competing for your attention), but having even just the rhythm guitar double tracked can feel so good to listen to.

Personally -- I have a love-hate relationship with it.

As good as it sounds, double tracking is quite literally double the effort to record. This can either be a minor time sink or a pain in the butt, depending on the difficulty of the section that I'm recording.

Fortunately, for this song, the only thing that needed double tracking was the rhythm guitar, and it was relatively easy to play, so I ended up doing it after getting another random burst of energy.

### time-aligning

For most of my music, I generally do high levels of "time-aligning" whever possible -- that is, I cut up the recordings and move the individual hits to line close to the grid. I don't force myself to do this if I can't -- for this cover, it wasn't really feasable to do this for the rhythm guitar as there's no breaks in the audio, so a cut would be noticable.

Except for the bridge, that is.

The rhythm guitar for most of the song acts as a "wall of sound" that doesn't need fine precision, but the bridge switches to a pattern with more defined "rhythmic hits" -- there's a lot of empty spaces that makes it easy to hear when stuff isn't aligned.

And so, we come to this:

*Audio editing agony.*

The rhythm section, edited to have no sound inbetween hits, otherwise you would've heard guitar noise.

> Q: Couldn't you have used a noise gate to filter out the sections?

> A: Maybe, but if anything went wrong I'd still have to manually polish it up.

It's probably worth mentioning that I basically did this whole thing in one take (well, one for each recording, so two takes technically). I could've made it easier for myself if I gave myself a better recording, but it was 1 AM at the time and I was burning out.
