Hello! This post just exists as testing data for the basic functionality of the website. Part of this testing includes seeing if my markdown text is being converted to HTML code, so I’ll need to have some sections in this post.

## what is this?

A blog, I think.

At least, that’s what I’m thinking of this as. The issue is that I have no intention of regularly updating it, so maybe it is a blog, but more in the sense that I write purely for myself sporadically when I feel like it?

## topics

There’s a few things that I might cover here:

- games i’ve worked on or am working on
- music stuff
- random code stuff

Basically, projects I’m working on. I like talking about the behind the scenes of stuff I’m working on, but it turns out that YouTube descriptions and randomly yapping to my friends about games isn’t ideal. A blog might not be either, but I like the idea of looking back on this and seeing what I was talking about.

I’m not sure who my audience is for this – other than me, anyways. Behind the scenes stuff is typically pretty technical but I’ll try my best to keep stuff understandable for a non-technical audience.

## technical details

rovi fill out later

Thank you for reading!
