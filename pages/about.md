Hi, I'm Rovi Decena! I'm a software developer that tends to have a lot of side projects running around.

#### what is this

A blog.

I like talking about projects I'm working on. After enough time spent making long, rambly descriptions on YouTube, or bombarding my friends with development/minor details, I figured that a blog might be better as an outlet.

For the most part, I'll be posting about projects I'm working on, or have worked on -- behind the scenes, retrospectives, etc.

My projects tend to revolve around these three topics:

- code (the main one)
- music (secondary)
- game dev (usually code + music)

#### audience

Because these posts are going to be (or are?) indepth regarding development details of my projects, they'll be getting pretty technical. I'll try my best to make stuff understandable to a wide audience, but still interesting for other programmers/musicians/developers.

It's probably better to try and cater more to one, but I think there's a fun challenge in allowing everyone to understand my yapping.

#### technical details

- This blog was built using Jekyll, using a heavily modified version of the no-style-please theme.
- The repository is hosted on GitHub.
- There is no automatic build process. I build the files on Jekyll, then transfer the build to my website.
    - I tried using GitHub Actions with their prebuilt Jekyll deployment thingy, but turns out there's issues with doing that because I wanted it to be hosted at `domain/blog` rather than `domain/`.

bonus:
- This blog was initially built using React + Vite. It did not go well, probably because I was trying to avoid having to actually make blog infrastrucutre, with a backend and database -- all that jazz.
    - I didn't want to use WordPress because that's boring. Part of the fun with this was/is coding it.
