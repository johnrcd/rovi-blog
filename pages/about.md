Hi, I'm Rovi Decena! I'm a software developer that tends to have a lot of side projects running around.

## what is this

A blog.

I like talking about projects I'm working on. After enough time spent making long, rambly descriptions on YouTube, or bombarding my friends with development/minor details, I figured that a blog might be better as an outlet.

For the most part, I'll be posting about projects I'm working on, or have worked on -- behind the scenes, retrospectives, etc.

My projects tend to revolve around these three topics:

- code (the main one)
- music (secondary)
- game dev (usually code + music)

## audience

Because these posts are going to be (or are?) indepth regarding development details of my projects, they'll be getting pretty technical. I'll try my best to make stuff understandable to a wide audience, but still interesting for other programmers/musicians/developers.

It's probably better to try and cater more to one, but I think there's a fun challenge in allowing everyone to understand my yapping.

## technical details

Okay, here's some information about how the site works; how I code and do music, etc. As the header implies, it's technical. Feel free to read, but unlike my posts, I won't try and simplify anything.

### site configuration
- This blog was built using Jekyll, using a heavily modified version of the no-style-please theme.
- The repository is hosted on GitHub.
- There is no automatic build process. I build the files on Jekyll, then transfer the build to my website.
    - I tried using GitHub Actions with their prebuilt Jekyll deployment thingy, but turns out there's issues with doing that because I wanted it to be hosted at `domain/blog` rather than `domain/`.
    - There's *probably* a way to get it builds on the server to be updated automatically, but... meh. I just do funny game code.

### previous attempt
- This blog was initially built using React + Vite. It did not go well, probably because I was trying to avoid having to actually make blog infrastrucutre, with a backend and database -- all that jazz.
    - I didn't want to use WordPress because that's boring. Part of the fun with this was/is coding it.

### creating, editing, and updating posts
- I use Visual Studio Code.
- I write posts in _drafts, but occasionally I'll use Google Docs if I want to write when I'm not at home.
    - I find that editing a markdown file directly helps me stay focused. I write for less, sure, but it's consistant.
- I have my IDE wrap the text markdown files to stay within 80 columns. This doesn't affect the actual code, so if you look into my source files and wonder why I have the longest lines possible, that's why.

### music!
- I produce music using Waveform Free.
    - Yes, I am using the free version of a paid DAW.
- I've used two other DAW's:
    - started off with Soundtrap (browser-based),
    - tried Ableton Live for ninety days when they hosted their free trial
- TECHNICALLY, I've tried FL Studio, but I think the workflow is awkward.
    - The only exception for that is automation clips; they look super useful. I wish Waveform had them!
- My music education is middle school and high school guitar classes.
- Vital is my main, general-purpose synthesizer. I basically don't use anything else.
    - Previously, I used Synth1, but I like Vital because it has nicer visuals that appeal to my brain.
- Other than Vital, I use these for sound making:
    - Spitfire LABS. Always a classic -- mostly because it's free.
    - BBC Symphony Orchestra -- I love strings in my songs! I've used a few synths/samples for strings before, but I'm currently using these right now.
    - A bunch of drum sample packs. Mainly, I use samples from CIRCLES, Cymatics, and Stiickz.
    - Ample Sound's ABPL2 -- bass VST using samples.
    - My own guitar. I record direct input.
- My main mixing plugins:
    - TDR Nova -- I use this as a regular EQ, a dynamic EQ, and a spectrogram. It does everything for me.
    - Valhalla Supermassive -- simple to use. Took awhile to get used to how powerful you could make your reverbs; almost all of the time, I have it cranked down low.
    - A bunch from Kilohearts; the compresser, limiter, delay, distortion, and gain. I like how barebones they are.
    - Native's Supercharger -- straight up, I usually just slap this on tracks where I want to reduce the dynamic range but I'm not sure how I want to approach it. This thing just kinda works.
    - Youlean Loudness Meter 2 -- Gotta make sure all my songs are (roughly) equal level.
