# Hello World

Hello! This post just exists as testing data for the basic functionality of the website. Part of this testing includes seeing if my markdown text is being converted to HTML code, so I’ll need to have some sections in this post.

## what is this?

A blog, I think.

At least, that’s what I’m thinking of this as. The issue is that I have no intention of regularly updating it, so maybe it is a blog, but more in the sense that I write purely for myself sporadically when I feel like it?

## topics

There’s a few things that I might cover here:
- games i’ve worked on or am working on
- music stuff
- random code stuff

Basically, projects I’m working on. I like talking about the behind the scenes of stuff I’m working on, but it turns out that YouTube descriptions and randomly yapping to my friends about games isn’t ideal. A blog might not be either, but I like the idea of looking back on this and seeing what I was talking about.

I’m not sure who my audience is for this – other than me, anyways. Behind the scenes stuff is typically pretty technical but I’ll try my best to keep stuff understandable for a non-technical audience.

## technical details

I’m trying to make this website relatively barebones. At the time of writing, I have literally none of this code written, but I think I’ll store the blog posts in .md files, then dynamically load them through a JSON file that acts as the middle-man by holding all the .md file links.

Wait I might need another JSON file hold on

Okay I have an idea of how this might work:
- .md file storing post data
- json file that stores .md file path + metadata
- json file that stores json file paths.
- Pages load json loader, filter out based on a post’s metadata

Yeah this is definitely a smart solution and will not backfire on me later

(I have no idea if this solution is correct let alone viable)

### backend

There is no backend. Only React code.

Q: why is this section here

A: so i can use the h3 tag

## random testing 

I’m going to start putting in the text shown in https://adamvleggett.github.io/drawdown/ so I can add all of these features.

### text decoration

- **bold**,
- *italic*
- ***both***
- ~~strikethrough~~
- `monospace`
- --subscript–
- and 
- ^^superscript^^

### tables, links, images, cooler lists

| Tables | Tables | Tables |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Cell 3 |
| Cell 4 | Cell 5 | Cell 6 |
| Cell 7 | Cell 8 | Cell 9 |
[Links](https://github.com/adamvleggett/drawdown)

Images:

1. Numbered lists
  - Unordered lists
  - Nested in other lists
    a. Lettered lists are an extension to the spec.
    b. They may be useful for legal documents.
2. Another entry in my numbered list.

#### wait i need an h4 tag to test

There we go.
